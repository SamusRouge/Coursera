<h1>dont be afraid to be &lt; then a 100% success &amp; &gt; more: </h1>

		&quot; it is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could havedone them better. the credit belong to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs who comes short again and again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who k nows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high acievement, and who at the wordst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory&nbsp; nor&nbsp; defeat.&quot;
